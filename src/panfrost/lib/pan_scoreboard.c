/*
 * There are various types of Mali jobs:
 *
 *  - WRITE_VALUE: generic write primitive, used to zero tiler field
 *  - VERTEX: runs a vertex shader
 *  - TILER: runs tiling and sets up a fragment shader
 *  - FRAGMENT: runs fragment shaders and writes out
 *  - COMPUTE: runs a compute shader
 *  - FUSED: vertex+tiler fused together, implicit intradependency (Bifrost)
 *  - GEOMETRY: runs a geometry shader (unimplemented)
 *  - CACHE_FLUSH: unseen in the wild, theoretically cache flush
 *
 * In between a full batch and a single Mali job is the "job chain", a series
 * of Mali jobs together forming a linked list. Within the job chain, each Mali
 * job can set (up to) two dependencies on other earlier jobs in the chain.
 * This dependency graph forms a scoreboard. The general idea of a scoreboard
 * applies: when there is a data dependency of job B on job A, job B sets one
 * of its dependency indices to job A, ensuring that job B won't start until
 * job A finishes.
 *
 * More specifically, here are a set of rules:
 *
 * - A write value job must appear if and only if there is at least one tiler
 *   job, and tiler jobs must depend on it.
 *
 * - Vertex jobs and tiler jobs are independent.
 *
 * - A tiler job must have a dependency on its data source. If it's getting
 *   data from a vertex job, it depends on the vertex job. If it's getting data
 *   from software, this is null.
 *
 * - Tiler jobs must depend on the write value job (chained or otherwise).
 *
 * - Tiler jobs must be strictly ordered. So each tiler job must depend on the
 *   previous job in the chain.
 *
 * - Jobs linking via next_job has no bearing on order of execution, rather it
 *   just establishes the linked list of jobs, EXCEPT:
 *
 * - A job's dependencies must appear earlier in the linked list (job chain).
 *
 * Justification for each rule:
 *
 * - Write value jobs are used to write a zero into a magic tiling field, which
 *   enables tiling to work. If tiling occurs, they are needed; if it does not,
 *   we cannot emit them since then tiling partially occurs and it's bad.
 *
 * - The hardware has no notion of a "vertex/tiler job" (at least not our
 *   hardware -- other revs have fused jobs, but --- crap, this just got even
 *   more complicated). They are independent units that take in data, process
 *   it, and spit out data.
 *
 * - Any job must depend on its data source, in fact, or risk a
 *   read-before-write hazard. Tiler jobs get their data from vertex jobs, ergo
 *   tiler jobs depend on the corresponding vertex job (if it's there).
 *
 * - The tiler is not thread-safe; this dependency prevents race conditions
 *   between two different jobs trying to write to the tiler outputs at the
 *   same time.
 *
 * - Internally, jobs are scoreboarded; the next job fields just form a linked
 *   list to allow the jobs to be read in; the execution order is from
 *   resolving the dependency fields instead.
 *
 * - The hardware cannot set a dependency on a job it doesn't know about yet,
 *   and dependencies are processed in-order of the next job fields.
 *

 * except for next_job accounting (TODO: Should we be clever and defer the
 * upload of the header here until next job to keep the access pattern totally
 * linear? Or is that just a micro op at this point?). Returns the generated
 * index for dep management.
 *
 * Inject is used to inject a job at the front, for wallpapering. If you are
